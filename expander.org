Modifying inserFragmentMarkers worked, but the color doesn't always show up.

Fixed the color situation by having the colors get added every time the expander template is rendered by adding a rendered function to the template.

Seems like deps.autorun might be re-rendering the page, in which case insertFragmentMarkers would be rerun and the hide class is added back again even if highlightedState is set to true.

Modify insertFragmentMarkers to only add hide class if highlightState is false

Highlight all for the expander in a fragments list isn't working because the click event is probably getting triggered twice due to the recursive template.  Fixed by adding stopImmediatePropagation() ot the event handler.

The brackets aren't showing up for the fragment expanders.  Probably something to do with selectMode.  Check it out for next time.
