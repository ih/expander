Highlight all for the expander in a fragments list isn't working because the click event is probably getting triggered twice due to the recursive template.  Fixed by adding stopImmediatePropagation() ot the event handler.

The brackets aren't showing up for the fragment expanders.  Probably something to do with selectMode.  Check it out for next time.
